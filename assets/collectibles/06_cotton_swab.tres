description = "A cotton swab? Fish donâ€™t have ears! How do they get to our beaches?

Unfortunately, many of us throw them in the toilet bowl instead of putting them in a garbage can. In the same way as condoms, sanitary napkins or tampon applicators, they are flushed and held at the entrance of the treatment plants."
