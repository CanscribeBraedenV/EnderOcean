description = "Sometimes we find strange objects from crime scenes underwater. In order to hide evidences and never get caught, thugs often get rid of their weapons into the sea. In 2011, a diver recovered a batch of firearms, submerged at a depth of 4 metres. In this type of situation, it is recommended to contact the maritime gendarmerie services."
